### Indirection
In computer programming, indirection (also called "dereferencing") is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself. The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its memory address. For example, accessing a variable through the use of a pointer.

- By Value
- By Reference
