The components...a mini push button. A classic push-to-make momentary switch. They only remain in their on state as long as theyâ€™re being actuated (pushed). Connection of this Single Pole, Single Throw (SPST Momentary) switch is normally easy, the pins are like a staple and the side where the pins don't come out is the entrance to the 2 staples behind each other. Pushing the button will connect two staples and create a circuit.
