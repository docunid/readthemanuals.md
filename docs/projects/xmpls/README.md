Eximples (XMPLS) is a stable coin with a pegged exchange rate against the EURO. In other words it is a utility token only suitable for paying me. After you bought them from me, for an EURO a piece... ;)

## create XMPLS

XMPLS originated on the Ethereum blockchain. Creating an utility token is easy as running a smart contract specifying the name, abbreviation, supply and some other properties for the token. Code it with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), make sure your wallet is connected (gas!) and publish it. Inform your wallet (for example Brave Browser Wallet) of the new tokens. Done :D
