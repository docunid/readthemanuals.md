# Angular (client)
Angular.js is a library/web application framework (open source JavaScript flavor of an MVC framework) for building client side web applications.

Together with Node en MongoDB as your data store you can build your entire infrastructure using JavaScript flavored tools. The MEAN stack is build on this observation.

# Bower
Front-end package manager. npm is most commonly used for managing Node.js modules, but it works for the front-end too when combined with Browserify and/or `npm dedupe`. Bower is created and optimized solely for the front-end.

# Express (server)
Express.js is a framework built on top of node.js for building server side web applications

# Gulp
Automate and enhance your workflow

In essence and with a lot of hand-waving away of details, Gulp and Grunt are both systems for automating series of inter-dependent tasks, commonly used for defining the "build" of your project, like a modern take on the `make` tool. Typically a project uses one of them or the other, but not both at the same time (for the same parts, anyway).

# Grunt
The JavaScript Task Runner, can be used as build system

# MEAN (stack)
MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js

# Node (server)
A JavaScript runtime (platform) built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine

# npm
Node Package Manager

# nvm
Node Version Manager

# Yarn
Dependency management, a package manager improving on npm
