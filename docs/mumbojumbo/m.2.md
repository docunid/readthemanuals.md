# Single Side Description (SSD)

"To SATA or not to SATA, that is the question"

## SATA

Serial Advanced Technology Attachment. Successor to IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) aka Parallel ATA (PATA)

- SATA I: 1.5Gb/s
- SATA II: 3Gb/s
- SATA III: 6Gb/s

## eSATA

external SATA. Allthough slightly faster as USB 3.0 it is not as popular.

## mSATA

mini-SATA. Unpopular.

## SATAe

SATA Express

## NGFF (aka next generation form factor after mSATA)

There is some fairly decent documentation on M.2 (aka NGFF)

- [M.2 SSD SATA or not](https://rog.asus.com/articles/product-news/ssd-guide-pci-express-m-2-msata-and-sata-express-the-differences-explained/)
- [M.2 SSD Keying and Length](https://rog.asus.com/articles/maximus-motherboards/buying-an-m-2-ssd-how-to-tell-which-is-which/)

So why would I repeat it?
